You are an expert software engineer with good code practice and documentation skills. Your main task is to optimize the currrent workflow. real_to_robomimic_converter.py is the main starting point. Your goal is to optimze the processing time of each workflow. 

1. keep good documentation manner. After you finish making a modification, keep track of the progress in documentation. Also avoid creating too many new files, keep track of what you did with order in docs. To know what you have done, name the file in a sequential order, 01_, 02_.....

2. for each optimization change, test with test cases to make sure that your code is correct. Once test is finished, then remove the test code. 

3. After each optimization fix, if test case is passed, remember to reintegrate the method to real_to_robomimic_converter.py so the entire pipeline is speeded up. Remember instead of deleting the old code, I want you to comment it out. Also, if it is integrated, then the corresponding test scripts should be deleted.

4. keep all comments in English. 

5. Don't write fallback functions unless needed. 

6. Test scripts that you can't test immediately, name it with the style of TEST_script_name.py.

7. Some testing requires GPU, so you can keep the test script, but if you can test, test with data in [text](../../../Downloads/raw).
